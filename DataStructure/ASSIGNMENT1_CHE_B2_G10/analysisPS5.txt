The Time Complexity based on the data structure used and its operations in the programs written are:

Doubly-Linked List: 
Used for storing the patient details.
   Typical operation performed:
	1.) Searching/Acessing the List      : O(n)
	2.) Insertion of records to the list : O(1)
	3.) Deletion of a patient once doctors appoinment is over - Theta(log n)

So in Total the List of patients has a running time complexity of O(n)

Max Heap:
Used for used for maintiaing Consult Queue.

Building the heap would take O(n) irrespective of whether the heap is max or min heap.

Heapifying the tree would cost us O(Log n)
deleting top of heap also would cost us O(Log n)

So, in Total the Consult queue has a running time complexity of O(n log n)
